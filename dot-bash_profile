# shellcheck shell=bash

# From man 1 bash:
# When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
# shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the
# file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file, it looks
# for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads
# and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
